     * BDD -> Behaviour Driven Development (Cucumber)
     *      In BDD testing strategy, we write scenarios in feature file.
     *      Each scenario reflect a user behavior.

     * DDT -> Data Driven Testing
     *      If a scenario/testcase is getting executed more than once with different data set.

     * How do a developers knows if the development(or work related to a particular feature) is done?
     * when all the points mentioned in the requirement is done.
     *
     * TDD -> Test Driven Development
     *      when the requirements are finalized, a qa-engg prepares all the testcases covering all requirements,
     *      even before the development starts.
     *
     * Developer make sure the requirements are done;
     *      but also runs the testcases to be sure that he completed the requirements in right way.
